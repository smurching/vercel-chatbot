# Databricks Asset Bundles tutorials

:re[DABS] describe Databricks resources such as jobs and pipelines as source files, allow you to include metadata alongside these source files to provision infrastructure and other resources, and provide an end-to-end definition of a project, all packaged as a single deployable project. See [\_](/dev-tools/bundles/index.md).

This page provides an overview of tutorials available to help you learn how to develop :re[DABS].

:::list-table

- - Tutorial
  - Description
- - [\_](/dev-tools/bundles/jobs-tutorial.md)
  - Create a bundle to programmatically manage a job. The bundle is created using the :re[DABS] default bundle template for Python, which consists of a notebook and the definition of a job to run it. You then validate, deploy, and run the deployed job in your Databricks workspace.
- - [\_](/dev-tools/bundles/pipelines-tutorial.md)
  - Create a bundle to programmatically manage :re[LDP]. The bundle is created using the :re[DABS] default bundle template for Python, which consists of a notebook and the definition of a pipeline and job to run it. You then validate, deploy, and run the deployed pipeline in your Databricks workspace.
- - [\_](/dev-tools/bundles/python-wheel.md)
  - Build, deploy, and run a Python wheel as part of a :re[DABS] project.
- - [\_](/dev-tools/bundles/scala-jar.md)
  - Build, deploy, and run a Scala JAR as part of a :re[DABS] project.
- - [\_](/dev-tools/bundles/mlops-stacks.md)
  - Create an MLOps Stacks bundle. An MLOps Stack is an MLOps project on Databricks that follows production best practices out of the box.
- - [\_](/dev-tools/bundles/manual-bundle.md)
  - Create a bundle from scratch, without using a template. This simple bundle consists of two notebooks and the definition of a Databricks job to run these notebooks. You then validate, deploy, and run the job in your Databricks workspace.
- - [\_](/dev-tools/bundles/template-tutorial.md)
  - Create a custom :re[DABS] template for creating bundles that run a job with a specific Python task on a cluster using a specific Docker container image. For information about custom bundle templates, see [\_](/dev-tools/bundles/templates.md#custom-templates).
