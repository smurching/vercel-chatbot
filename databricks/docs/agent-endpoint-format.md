Here are two common examples:\n\n1. **Iterating over a collection (like an array):**\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];\n\n    for element in a {\n        println!(\"the value is: {element}\");\n    }\n}\n```\nThis will print each value in the array.[^ySwa-2]\n\n2. **Iterating over a range of numbers:**\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    for number in 1..4 {\n        println!(\"{number}![^ySwa-3]\");\n    }\n}\n```\nThis will print numbers 1, 2, and 3. If you want to include 4, use `1..=4`.\n\nYou can also reverse a range:\n```rust\nfor number in (1..4).rev() {\n    println!(\"{number}![^ySwa-3]\");\n}\n```\n\nRust's for loops are preferred because they're concise, safe (no risk of going out of bounds), and efficient.\n\nLet me know if you want more details or examples!\n\n[^ySwa-1]: The safety and conciseness of for loops make them the most commonly used loop construct in Rust. _3.5_22_\n[^ySwa-2]: Filename: src/main.rs fn main() {  let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];   for element in a {  println!(\"the value is: {element}\");  } } _3.5_21_\n[^ySwa-3]: fn main() {  for number in (1..4).rev() {  println!(\"{number}!\");  }  println!(\"LIFTOFF!!!\"); } _3.5_23_"}]}], "id": "3a6b9134-2cd2-47bd-9197-3d02b3ef1775"}
